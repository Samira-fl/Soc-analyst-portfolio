This document summarizes the seven steps of the Cyber Kill Chain model developed by Lockheed Martin. It is used to understand and defend against cyber attacks by modeling attacker behavior.

## ðŸ”’ Steps of the Cyber Kill Chain

1. **Reconnaissance**  
   Attacker gathers information using passive or active techniques.

2. **Weaponization**  
   Attacker creates or configures a payload or exploit based on gathered information.

3. **Delivery**  
   Malicious content is sent to the victim via email, USB, web, etc.

4. **Exploitation**  
   The exploit is triggered or malware is executed on the victimâ€™s system.

5. **Installation**  
   Malware is installed or a backdoor is placed to ensure persistence.

6. **Command and Control (C2)**  
   Attacker establishes communication with the system to control it remotely.

7. **Actions on Objectives**  
   Attacker performs intended actions such as data exfiltration or destruction.

## ðŸ”§ Defender's Perspective

At each stage, blue teams can take detection and prevention steps:
- Use Threat Intelligence & Pentests.
- Monitor endpoints and network for anomalies.
- Apply EDR and DLP tools.
- Train staff and enforce secure configurations.
